       1. fiducial values changed, especially, n changed from 0.1 to 0.0001;
       2. relative errors are modified

 Independent variable is A (eta), the conformal time
 lower case 'a' is the scale factor
Y(1) = a
Y(2) = a'
Y(3) = a''
Y(4) = delta
Y(5) = delta'

The system consists of the following 5 rate
equations:
1, YDOT(1) = a' = Y(2)
2, YDOT(2) = a'' = Y(3)
3, YDOT(3) = a''' = ...
4, YDOT(4) = delta' = Y(5)
5, YDOT(5) = delta'' = ...

All length/time quantities are in unit of Gyr (or Gyr^-1);
All density quantities are in unit of 8 \pi G * ['normal' density],
but density appears in formulas only in form of dimensionless \Omega,
making its actual unit irrelevant;

The initial conditions are *not* trivial, neither (Y)s and A, nor
(Y')s; 
Initial value of Y(5) (delta') is set to a' at the same A (eta);
this is argued to be due to similar behavior of $delta(a)$ in 
f(R) theory and in LCDM, which seems to be the case in the figures
shown in the paper. 

Problems to be solved:
1. A clever way to pick the wanted k (used to plot the growth history)
